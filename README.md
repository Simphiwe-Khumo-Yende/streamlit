# YouCrawler

YouCrawler is a web-based tool that allows users to scrape video transcripts from specific YouTube channels or custom video URLs. The app is built using Streamlit and utilizes YouTube's API for fetching video transcripts. Users can input a YouTube channel username or provide custom video URLs, and the tool retrieves and processes the transcripts.

## Features

- Fetch video transcripts from a YouTube channel (by username) or custom video URLs.
- Retry mechanism for handling rate limits and errors during transcript fetching.
- Bulk transcript extraction for entire channels or multiple videos.
- Auto-cleanup for temporary files used in transcript processing.
- Download processed transcripts directly from the web interface.
